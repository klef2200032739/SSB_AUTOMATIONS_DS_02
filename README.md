Basic Plotting with Matplotlib and Seaborn



















This repository includes examples and scripts for creating basic plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to visualize data distributions. Whether you're exploring data trends, identifying outliers, or presenting insights, these tools simplify the process of generating clear and informative visualizations.

Key Plot Types:



















Histograms: Visualize the distribution of numerical data.

















Scatter Plots: Explore relationships between variables through point clouds.

























Features:





















Matplotlib: Flexible plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.




















Seaborn: Built on Matplotlib, provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
These examples demonstrate how to customize plots, add labels, legends, and other annotations to enhance clarity and understanding of data patterns.

Explore the scripts and documentation to incorporate these plotting capabilities into your data analysis workflows.
